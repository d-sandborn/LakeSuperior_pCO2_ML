# LakeSuperior_pCO2_ML
Predicting surface pCO2 on Lake Superior with machine learning tools. This repository contains code necessary to replicate a feed-forward neural network model described in a manuscript under review:

Sandborn, D.E.; Minor, E.C.; Austin, J.A. (2025). "A neural network-based estimate of the seasonal to inter-annual variability of the Lake Superior carbon cycle". Submitted to the _Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences_. 

Underway measurements on which this work is based can be found at the [R2R repository for the UNOLS vessel RV Blue Heron](https://www.rvdata.us/search/vessel/Blue%20Heron).
